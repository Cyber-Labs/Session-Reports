//Important Concepts discussed:

* The data will persist even when the user closes the application
* getSharedPreference() is always global. 
* SQLite Database is similar to storing data in Excel sheet. 
* Entities are defined in Room using annotations. 
* Primary key is a column by which each record is uniquely identified. 
* Create, Read, Update and Delete are the basic functions performed using Database. 
* DAO (Data Access Object) - Interface where queries are defined using
annotations.
* RoomDB is designed to work with all other architectural
components.
