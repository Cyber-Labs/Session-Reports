# Session 3
View Binding and Data Binding with Introduction to Kotlin
Conducted on: 13/06/2022

## Agenda
To learn the various uses, features and implementation of View Binding and Data Binding.

## Summary
The discussion was held on how to link view to the code directly without using findViewById instead using View Binding and Data Binding.

## The following things were discussed: 
      * Firstly, how to declare and initialise variables & values in Kotlin were discussed.
      * Setting data binding and view binding: 
          * In build.gradle--->buildFeatures---> dataBinding true, or viewBinding true. 
          * Creation of a 'binding' variable in MainActivity.kt
          * How to setContent view using Binding class instance and DataBindingUtil class.
          * Use of <data> and <variable> tags and there attributes to give name and type to the variable in the xml.
          * How to access variables in the data using binding.<variablename>.
          
      * Using this concept, we implemented it in a recyclerView.
      * Made a viewHolder.xml for the view to be repeated.
      * A data class & adapter for it was made.
      * In the adapter, an inner class of type ViewHolder was made in which a list was made and the method for setting the recyclerview with the list was made
      and the following methods were overriden:
        * onCreateViewHolder
        * onBindViewHolder
        * getItemCount
    *The list was modified in MainActivitya and the adapter was set to it.
 The session was concluded with a small doubt clearing session.
