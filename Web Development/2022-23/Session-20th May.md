# Session 1
Meet with first years, yelpcamp course
Conducted on: 16/04/2023

## Agenda
- Meeting with Cyberlabs Web Division Second-Year Seniors, discussing the roadmap for the next few months.

## Summary

- Providing course (The Web Developer Bootcamp – Colt Steele) for learning backend and making YelpCamp project.
- The above-mentioned project has to be made using the code-along technique.
- For making forms, Bootstrap may be used (as done in the Project), but for the rest of the Project, it is advised to use Tailwind as CSS-Framework.
- Apart from development-related tips, the First years are now advised to focus on academics and try to increase their CGPA, because only the first few semesters’ SGPA would make a considerable difference in CGPA.
