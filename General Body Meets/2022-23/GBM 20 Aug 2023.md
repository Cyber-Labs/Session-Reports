## Agenda

## Summary
### Competitive Programming ( a.k.a CP )
Discussion over its importance and redundancy.
### Career Development Centre( a.k.a CDC )
Discussion over the incapability of IIT(ISM)’s CDC’s to reach out to major companies for the various 
divisions of Cyberlabs with regard to internships and placements, leading to an over-reliance on CP for only 
Software Development (SD) offers; concluding on the necessity of having our own CDC body, temporarily
