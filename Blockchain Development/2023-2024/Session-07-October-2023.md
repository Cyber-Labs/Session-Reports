# Session

Conducted on: 07/10/23

## Agenda

Introduction To Solidity and OpenZepplin Contracts

## Resources

https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/

## Summary

1. Mapping and Nested Mapping (get, set and remove)
2. Arrays (syntax, push, pop, remove)
3. Why is memory keyword used? Memory doesn’t use gas while storage does.
4. Enum : makes code readable. Maps elements with numbers in the order they are defined.
5. Constructor: Value can only be added while creating the constructor. Can’t be modified afterwards.
6. Difference between ERC1155 and ERC721
   The Gas consumption of Memory is not very significant as compared to the gas consumption of Storage. It's not that it doesn't need gas.
