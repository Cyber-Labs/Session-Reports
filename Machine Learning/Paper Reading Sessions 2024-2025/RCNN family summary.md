## R-CNN: The Foundation (2014)
### Key Innovation: CNN + Region Proposals
- First successful integration of CNNs with region proposals for object detection
- Transformed object detection from traditional hand-engineered features (like HOG) to learned features
- Introduced the concept of transfer learning in object detection through ImageNet pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning

### Novel Implementation Details:
- Three-stage pipeline:
  1. Generate ~2000 region proposals using selective search
  2. Extract CNN features from each proposal independently
  3. Classify using class-specific SVMs
- Achieved 61% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art (DPM)
- Careful IoU threshold selection for negative samples (0.3) proved crucial

## Fast R-CNN (2015)
### Key Innovation: Shared Computation
- Revolutionized efficiency by processing the entire image once, rather than processing each region proposal separately
- Introduced RoI (Region of Interest) pooling layer for feature extraction from shared feature maps
- Pioneered multi-task learning in object detection

### Novel Implementation Details:
- Single-stage training process replacing R-CNN's multi-stage pipeline
- Multi-task loss function combining classification (softmax) and bounding box regression
- Hierarchical sampling strategy for mini-batch construction
- No need for feature caching on disk
- Achieved 98Ã— speedup in testing compared to R-CNN

## Faster R-CNN (2015)
### Key Innovation: Learned Region Proposals
- Introduced Region Proposal Network (RPN) - the first end-to-end learned approach for generating region proposals
- Pioneered the concept of "anchors" as reference boxes for predictions
- Achieved nearly cost-free region proposals (~10ms per image)

### Novel Implementation Details:
- Unified architecture where RPN shares full-image convolutional features with detection network
- Novel anchor-based prediction scheme handling multiple scales and aspect ratios
- Four-step alternating training method for learning shared features
- Reduced proposal generation time from ~2s (Selective Search) to 10ms
- Achieved 5 FPS processing speed (vs 0.5 FPS in Fast R-CNN)

## Mask R-CNN (2017)
### Key Innovation: Instance Segmentation
- Added parallel mask prediction branch while maintaining detection performance
- Introduced RoIAlign for precise pixel-to-pixel alignment
- Pioneered "instance-first" strategy for instance segmentation

### Novel Implementation Details:
- RoIAlign layer using bilinear interpolation, eliminating quantization-induced misalignment
- FCN-based mask branch predicting masks in a pixel-to-pixel manner
- Class-specific mask prediction without class competition
- Decoupled mask and class prediction allowing per-class mask generation
- RoIAlign improved AP by ~3 points and AP75 by ~5 points over RoIPool
