# Paper-Reading Session: ResNet
Conducted on: 05/11/2023

## Agenda
Discussion over Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (ResNet) .

## Resources
Paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385

## Session Summary
### Paper Discussion
Discussed by Alok Raj, overseen by Shreshth Sharma.

### Doubt Discussion
Hypothesis function for ResNets, Universal function approximating nature of neural networks, Highway Network vs ResNets, Notation clarification, Different ways to "add" activations after short-connections, Narrow minimas vs Wide minimas.

### End-Semester queries
Discussion over the upcoming end semester examination (Monsoon 2023-2024).

### Problems to Ponder
#### Does Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) lead to overfitting or underfitting? 
#### Why are minimas attained by using SGD wider than those of Batch GD? 

## Agenda for the next session
