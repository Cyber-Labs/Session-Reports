- Extracting archives of various formats in colab
- Using Google TPU for improvement in training speed

### Advanced Keras

- **Keras Callbacks**: 
  - Model Checkpoint
  - Early Stopping
  - Learning Rate Scheduler

- **Data Generators** 
  - Custom data generator using Object Oriented Concept.
  - Used custom data generator on MNIST dataset and trained a basic convolutional model, all using keras.

### Misc

- Introductory Video to Tensorboard
- A brief discussion on Computational Graphs
