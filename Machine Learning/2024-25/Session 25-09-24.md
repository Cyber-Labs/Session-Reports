# Session of Machine Learning Division of CyberLabs
Conducted on: 25 September 2024
## Agenda
Discussion of MobileNetv1 and MobileNetv2 research papers
## Summary
1. MobilenetV1 and MobilenetV2 are neural networks optimized for mobile devices and systems with limited computing power
2. MobilenetV1 uses depthwise separable convolutions:
   - Splits large calculations into two smaller ones
   - Makes processing faster and reduces memory requirements
3. MobilenetV2 improves upon V1 by adding:
   - Inverted residuals that handle most data in smaller, simpler layers
   - Linear bottlenecks that preserve important information
4. These improvements make MobilenetV2 more accurate and better suited for tasks like image recognition and object detection while maintaining lightweight and fast performance
