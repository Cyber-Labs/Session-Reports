# Session of Machine Learning Division of CyberLabs:

Conducted on 10th March 2025  
## Agenda of Meet  
Discussion on Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

## Summary  
We discussed the core concepts of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), including the difference between regular autoencoders and VAEs, the intuition behind the encoder-decoder architecture, the role of KL divergence, and how VAEs generate data. Common doubts were addressed, especially regarding the loss function, the reparameterization trick, and applications of VAEs in generative modeling.
