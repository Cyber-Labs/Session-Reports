# Session of Machine Learning Division of CyberLabs
Conducted on: 2 November 2024
## Agenda
Discussion of RCNN, Fast RCNN and Faster RCNN
## Summary
1. We discussed the RCNN, Fast RCNN and Faster RCNN
2. RCNN object detection system consists of three modules:
   - First module generates category-independent region proposals
   - Second module is a large convolutional neural network that extracts a fixed-length feature vector from each region
   - Third module is a set of class specific linear SVMs
3. Fast RCNN makes RCNN faster by using ROI Pooling
4. Faster RCNN further improves on Fast RCNN by making Region Proposal network fully Convolutional and using ROI pooling
## Agenda for the next session
Paper Discussion on Masked RCNN and YOLO
