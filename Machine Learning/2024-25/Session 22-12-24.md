# Session of Machine Learning Division of CyberLabs  
**Conducted on:** 22 December 2024  
**Time:** 12 PM  
**Mode:** Online  

## Agenda  
1. LSTM: A recurrent neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data effectively by addressing the vanishing gradient problem.  
2. Applications: Explored the use of LSTMs in tasks like natural language processing, time-series prediction, and speech recognition.  
3. Innovations: Discussed key components like memory cells, input/output gates, and forget gates that make LSTMs robust for long-term dependencies.  

## Agenda for the next session  
**Discussion of different types of Normalizations (BatchNorm, LayerNorm, Group Norm, RMS Norm)**
